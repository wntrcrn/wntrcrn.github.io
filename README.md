## FEATURED:  How long did the Roman empire last?

The Roman empire was a very long lived entity lasting for approximately 2 millenia. The story starts in 753 BC with the probably legendary or fictional Roman kingdom which had the city of Rome as its only territory. The kingdom was then replaced in 509 BC by a republic due to the tyrannical king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. With the republic large swathes of land were conquered by Rome in wars of conquest such as the Punic wars, whom the Romans faced their biggest enemy, Hannibal.

A century after the Punic wars Rome would have its greatest and most famous citizen, the conqueror of Gaul (modern day France) Gaius Julius Caesar. Caesar then provoked a civil war (in which where he won) then declared himself dictator for life, but would be assassinated by the Roman senators beleiving that he will become another king like Tarquinius Superbus. His death in 44 AD started a bloody civil war, but among the victors were his adopted son Octavian who is truly the first Roman emperor, the last of the republic, the first of the empire.
